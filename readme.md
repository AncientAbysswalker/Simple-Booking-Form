## Implementation

Simple implementation of a booking form. The form allows you to select seats for a movie viewing, and has simple local storage. The form has the following features:

- Seats that are not considered "unavailable" are toggleable and can be set aside for reservation
- The bottom of the page indicates how many seats you have selected and the cost to reserve all these seats, and reiterates the viewing time you have selected
- Selecting a new viewing time loads what seats are already booked and thus unavailable for that viewing, and deselects all seats
